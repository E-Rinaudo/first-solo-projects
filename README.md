# first_solo_projects

A collection of Python projects I completed independently while studying Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

## Introduction

Welcome to my "first_solo_projects" repository.

Here, you'll find a variety of projects, from practical applications like a spaced repetition reminder and a fitness interval timer to interactive games inspired by the "Alien Invasion" project. Additionally, there are data visualizations projects using libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly. Each project reflects the skills and concepts I developed during the course.

Feel free to explore the subdirectories for detailed information about each projects. Your feedback is appreciated as it helps me to continue improving.
