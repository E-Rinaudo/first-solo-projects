# first_solo_projects

A collection of my first solo Python projects done while studying Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

# Introduction

Welcome to my "first_solo_projects" repository! Here, you'll find a compilation of projects I've undertaken independently while going through the "Python Crash Course" book. These projects are not exercises from the book but programs I've developed to practice and enhance my Python skills.

Feel free to explore these projects and if you want, please provide feedback to help me improve.

# Projects List

**Project 1**: repetition_days/study_method.py

**Description**:
This program utilizes a spaced repetition method to remind users of specific study tasks on different days of the week. It generates a pop-up reminder daily, detailing the tasks scheduled for that particular day based on a predefined study plan.

**Project 2**: hurricane_clock/hurricane_clock.py

**Description**:
This program simulates timed exercise intervals for the Hurricane Hypertrophy month of NXT in Athlean-X, a popular fitness program created by Jeff Cavaliere. Athlean-X offers structured workout regimens designed to improve fitness. The program prompts the user to input details such as the muscle being trained, the number of sets, and the exercise type. It then runs a clock for each set, alternating between 20-second and 40-second intervals with sound cues for timing. This structure replicates the workout regimen outlined in the Hurricane Hypertrophy program within Athlean-X.

**Projects 3-4-5-6**: games/alien_invasion/, games/hungry_fox/, games/sideways_shooter/, games/sliding_penguin/

**Description**:
These projects were developed while working through chapters 12, 13, and 14 of Python Crash Course. Each game is inspired by the "Alien Invasion" project from the book, serving as a foundation to explore and enhance my understanding of the concepts covered.

The following games share foundational concepts with Alien Invasion, each with some unique twists.

alien_invasion: A classic arcade-style game where the player controls a spaceship and must shoot down waves of aliens descending from the sky. This project includes additional features beyond those covered in the book.

hungry_fox: A game where the player controls a fox that kills farmers.

sideways_shooter: A variation of Alien Invasion where the player shoots at enemies that come horizontally.

sliding_penguin: A game featuring a penguin that shoots down randomly generated orcas.

**Projects 7-8-9**:  data_visualization/random_walks/molecular_motion/, data_visualization/rolling_dice/, data_visualization/random_walks/firefly_random_walk/, 

**Description**:
These projects were developed while working through chapters 15, 16, and 17 of Python Crash Course.

molecular_motion: This project uses Matplotlib to visualize the random walk of a pollen grain on the surface of a drop of water. The MolecularMotion class simulates this random walk, producing a series of steps in a two-dimensional space with varying directions and distances. The resulting plot demonstrates the path taken by the pollen grain over a specified number of steps.

rolling_dice: This project uses Matplotlib to visualize the results of rolling two six-sided dice 50,000 times. The DieVisual class handles the creation of the two dice, performs the rolls, analyzes the frequency of each possible result, and generates a bar chart to display the results.

firefly_random_walk: This project uses Plotly to visualize  the random walk of a firefly on a summer night. The Firefly_Walk class simulates the random movements over a series of steps in a two-dimensional space. The visualization highlights the starting point, ending point, and the trajectory of the firefly's journey. Each point on the walk is represented by a star symbol in varying shades of orange, symbolizing the firefly's flickering light. The plot is set against a black background to emphasize the nocturnal nature of the firefly's dance.

# Usage
Each project in this repository can be executed independently. Simply open the respective Python file in your preferred Python environment (such as VSCode or IDLE) and run it to observe the project in action.
