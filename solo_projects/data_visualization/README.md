# data_visualization

This directory contains projects focused on visualizing data using Matplotlib and Plotly. These projects were developed working through chapter 15-16-17 of Python Crash Course.

## Contents

**earthquakes/**:
This project visualizes earthquake data, using Plotly. The module reads data from GeoJSON files and plots them to show their geographical distribution and intensity.

**github_python_julia_r_repos/**:
This project visualizes the top 20 most-starred repositories on GitHub for Python, Julia, and R, using Plotly. It extracts data from GitHubâ€™s API and displays the repository names and star counts in separate subplots for each programming language.

**meteorology_visuals/**:
This project visualizes weather data, using Matplotlib. It reads weather data from CSV files and generates various visualizations.

**random_walks**:
This subdirectory contains two projects that visualize random walks using different Python libraries.

- firefly_random_walk/: This project uses Plotly to visualize the random walk of a firefly on a summer night. It simulates the random movements in a two-dimensional space.

- molecular_motion/: This project uses Matplotlib to visualize the random walk of a pollen grain on the surface of a drop of water. It simulates this random walk, producing a series of steps in a two-dimensional space.

**rolling_dice/**:
This project visualizes the results of rolling two six-sided dice 50,000 times using Matplotlib.

**wildfires/**:
This project visualizes wildfire data, using Plotly. It reads wildfire data from CSV files and creates visualizations to represent the intensity and spread of wildfires.

## Usage

Each project within this directory can be executed independently. Navigate to the respective subdirectory and run the Python files to see the visualizations in action.
