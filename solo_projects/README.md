A collection of interactive games inspired by the "Alien Invasion" project, each with unique features.

A project simulating timed exercise intervals for a fitness program.

**repetition_days/**:

## Usage

Each project can be executed independently. Navigate to the respective subdirectory and run the Python files to see the projects in action.
