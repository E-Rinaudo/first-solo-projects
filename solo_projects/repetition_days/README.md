# repetition_days

Repetition Days is a simple program designed to help with study planning by generating daily reminders based on a spaced repetition method. It utilizes a pop-up window to display the tasks scheduled for the current day, ensuring one stays on track with the study goals.

## Files

**pop_up.py**:
This module defines the 'StudyPopUp' class, which generates a pop-up window using Tkinter. The pop-up displays the current date, the subject being studied, and the tasks to be completed for that day.

**study_method.py**:
This script sets up a study schedule for each day of the week and defines the tasks to be repeated. It creates an instance of the 'StudyPopUp' class to show a pop-up with the study tasks for the current day.

## Dependencies

**Tkinter**: For creating the graphical pop-up window. (Python Standard Library)
**Datetime**: For handling and formatting dates. (Python Standard Library)

## Usage

Execute study_method.py from your terminal or preferred IDE.
For convenience, consider creating a terminal alias to run the script automatically each day.
